Imbalanced Datasets: In imbalanced datasets where some classes have significantly fewer samples than others, it can be challenging to evaluate the performance of a classifier accurately using a regular confusion matrix.

These metrics are \"extrinsic\" because they evaluate a model's performance in the context of a broader task or application, rather than assessing the model's internal properties or capabilities in isolation.\n",

Train or Fine-Tune a Language Model: You may train a language model from scratch or fine-tune a pre-existing model (e.g., a pre-trained transformer-based model like BERT, GPT-3, or RoBERTa) on the dataset you've collected for the specific task. Fine-tuning is a common approach, as it leverages the knowledge already present in pre-trained models and adapts it to the target task.\n",

        "Accuracy is a commonly used metric for evaluating classification models in machine learning, but it has certain limitations, and it may not provide a complete picture of a model's performance, especially in situations with imbalanced datasets or when different types of errors have varying consequences. Here are some limitations of using accuracy as a sole evaluation metric for classification tasks and ways to address these limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Imbalanced Datasets:\n",
        "\n",
        "Limitation: Accuracy can be misleading when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class significantly outnumbers the others. A model that predicts the majority class for every instance may still achieve a high accuracy despite not being useful.\n",
        "Addressing: Consider using other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) that take into account true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. These metrics provide a more balanced view of performance.\n",
        "2. Different Misclassification Costs:\n",
        "\n",
        "Limitation: In some classification problems, misclassifying one class might have more severe consequences than misclassifying another class. Accuracy treats all misclassifications equally.\n",
        "Addressing: Use cost-sensitive learning techniques or adjust the classification threshold to minimize the specific type of error that is more critical for your problem. You can also use custom loss functions that reflect the misclassification costs.\n",

        "\n",
        "Limitation: In binary classification, if the positive and negative classes are imbalanced, a high accuracy can be achieved by simply predicting the majority class.\n",
        "Addressing: Besides accuracy, calculate and consider metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and the AUC-ROC curve to assess the model's performance on both classes. You can also use techniques like resampling, cost-sensitive learning, or synthetic data generation to balance the dataset.\n",
        "4. Multiclass Problems:\n",
        "\n",
        "Limitation: In multiclass classification, accuracy can be influenced by the class distribution, and it might not reveal which classes are more challenging to predict.\n",
        "Addressing: Utilize confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and class-specific metrics to assess the model's performance on individual classes. Additionally, micro-averaging and macro-averaging of metrics can provide a comprehensive view of multiclass performance.\n",
        "5. Ordinal or Continuous Predictions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Limitation: When the prediction output of a classifier is ordinal or continuous (e.g., probabilities), accuracy may not apply directly.\n",
        "Addressing: Choose an appropriate threshold or transformation to convert the continuous predictions into discrete labels. Then, use classification metrics suitable for the transformed labels.\n",
        "6. Noisy Data or Label Errors:\n",

        "Limitation: Accuracy assumes that the ground truth labels are correct, but in practice, data may contain noise or label errors.\n",
