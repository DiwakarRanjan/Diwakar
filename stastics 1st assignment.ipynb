    "# Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "#     Descriptive statistics involves the collection, organization, and presentation of data in order to describe and summarize it. \n",
    "#     It provides a summary of the data using measures such as mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation.\n",
    "# Example: Suppose a researcher wants to describe the distribution of heights among a group of individuals. \n",
    "#          They can use descriptive statistics to calculate the mean height, median height, range of heights, and standard deviation of heights among the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "#Inferential statistics involves making inferences and predictions about a population based on data collected from a sample. \n",
    "#  It allows us to generalize the results from a sample to the larger population from which the sample was drawn.\n",
    "# Example: Suppose a company wants to estimate the average income of its customers. \n",
    "#         It can take a random sample of its customers, calculate the average income of the sample, and use inferential statistics to estimate the average income of all its customers. This estimation is made with a confidence interval or hypothesis test, that provides the level of uncertainty or evidence to support the inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Both types of statistics are important and complementary in statistical analysis. \n",
    "#Descriptive statistics provides a summary of the data, while inferential statistics allows us to make predictions about a population based on sample data."

    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the average value of a dataset, obtained by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of observations. The mean is useful for describing the typical value of a dataset.\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in numerical order. The median is useful for describing the central value of a dataset when there are extreme values or outliers present.\n",

    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. The range is useful for describing the spread of a dataset, but it is sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "Variance: The variance is a measure of how spread out the data is from the mean. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each value and the mean, and dividing by the number of observations minus one. The variance is useful for describing the degree of variability in a dataset.\n",
    "Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average amount by which each value in the dataset deviates from the mean. The standard deviation is useful for describing the spread of a dataset, and it is more interpretable than the variance because it is in the same units as the original data"
