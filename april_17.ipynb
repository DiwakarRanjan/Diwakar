        "Gradient Boosting Regression is a machine learning technique used for solving regression problems, which involve predicting a continuous numeric output variable based on one or more input features. It is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to create a strong predictive model.\n",

        "\n",

Building Weak Learners (Decision Trees): A weak learner, usually a decision tree with limited depth (often referred to as a \"shallow tree\" or \"stump\"), is trained on the training data. The tree is trained to minimize the residual errors between the current predictions and the actual target values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Weighted Sum: The predictions from the weak learner are multiplied by a small learning rate (also known as the shrinkage parameter) and added to the current predictions. This step helps control the contribution of each weak learner to the final model.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Update Residuals: The residuals (the differences between the current predictions and the actual target values) are computed, and the next weak learner is trained to predict these residuals. This process continues iteratively.\n",

        "5. Repeat: Steps 3 and 4 are repeated for a predefined number of iterations or until a certain stopping criterion is met. In each iteration, a new weak learner is added to the ensemble to correct the errors made by the previous ones.\n",

        "6. Final Prediction: The final prediction is obtained by summing up the predictions from all weak learners."

Ensemble Learning: Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique, which means it combines the predictions of multiple models (often simple models called weak learners) to create a stronger and more accurate model. The basic idea is that by combining the predictions of multiple models, you can leverage their individual strengths and compensate for their weaknesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Sequential Improvement: Gradient Boosting builds an ensemble of weak learners sequentially. It starts with an initial prediction (usually a simple one, like the mean of the target values) and then adds one weak learner at a time. Each weak learner is trained to correct the errors made by the previous ensemble of learners. This sequential nature is what makes Gradient Boosting different from other ensemble methods like Random Forest, which build learners independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Gradient Descent: The \"Gradient\" in Gradient Boosting comes from the fact that it uses gradient descent optimization to minimize a loss function. In each iteration, the algorithm calculates the gradient (a measure of the error) of the loss function with respect to the current predictions. It then fits a new weak learner to this gradient, essentially learning how to correct the errors made by the previous predictions. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a fixed number of iterations or until the loss converges).\n",

Smaller learning rates make the process more robust but require more iterations.\n",

Weighted Addition: The predictions from the weak learner are multiplied by a small learning rate (also called the shrinkage parameter) and added to the current predictions of the ensemble. This step is critical because it controls the contribution of the new weak learner and ensures a gradual improvement in the ensemble's predictions.\n",
