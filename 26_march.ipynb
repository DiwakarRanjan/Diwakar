        "Check: You can visually inspect scatter plots of the independent variables against the dependent variable. If the points form a roughly linear pattern, this assumption may hold. Additionally, residual plots can help assess linearity; residuals should be randomly distributed around zero.\n",

        "Assumption: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. The error of one observation should not be related to the error of another observation.\n",
        "Check: You can use a Durbin-Watson test or inspect autocorrelation plots of the residuals to check for independence. A lack of significant autocorrelation indicates that this assumption is met.\n",

        "Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used in machine learning and various other domains. It's primarily employed to minimize the cost function or loss function of a model by adjusting its parameters iteratively. Here's a detailed explanation of the concept and its role in machine learning:\n",

        "Concept:\n",
        "Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. In the context of machine learning, this function is typically the cost function or loss function. The cost function quantifies how well a machine learning model performs on a given dataset. The goal of training a machine learning model is to find the model's parameters (e.g., weights and biases in a neural network) that minimize this cost function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient Descent works by starting with an initial guess for the parameters and iteratively updating them in the direction of the steepest descent (the negative gradient) of the cost function. The gradient represents the rate of change of the cost function with respect to each parameter. By following the negative gradient, the algorithm seeks to move closer to the minimum of the cost function, effectively reducing the cost and improving the model's performance.\n",

        "Steps of Gradient Descent:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initialization: Start with an initial guess for the model's parameters, often chosen randomly or with some heuristics.\n",

        "5. Optimization: Eventually, the algorithm converges to a point where the gradient is nearly zero, indicating that it has found a local minimum of the cost function.\n",

        "Gradient Descent plays a crucial role in machine learning in the following ways:\n",

        "2. Model Parameter Optimization: Gradient Descent helps find the optimal values of model parameters by adjusting them in the direction that minimizes the cost. This process is essential for model learning and generalization.\n",

While simple linear regression models the relationship between two variables, multiple linear regression models the relationship between multiple predictors and a single dependent variable. Here's how multiple linear regression differs from simple linear regression:\n",

        "Multicollinearity is a common issue in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other. This high degree of correlation can create problems during the modeling process, as it can make it difficult to determine the individual impact of each predictor variable on the dependent variable. Here's a more detailed explanation of multicollinearity and how to detect and address it:\n",
        "\n",
        "Concept of Multicollinearity:\n",

Consequences: Multicollinearity doesn't affect the predictive power of the model, but it can lead to inaccurate or unstable coefficient estimates, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions about the relationship between predictors and the dependent variable. It can also make the model sensitive to small changes in the data.\n",

        "2. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): VIF measures how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient increases when your predictors are correlated.

This can be done based on domain knowledge or the relevance of the variables to the research question. Alternatively, you can create composite variables by combining correlated predictors.\n",

Overfitting: As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model can become increasingly complex and prone to overfitting, where it fits the noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern.
