        "Issue: Outliers can have a significant impact on logistic regression, especially if they are influential points.\n",
        "Solution:\n",
        "Identify and handle outliers through techniques like Winsorization (clipping extreme values), robust regression methods, or excluding extreme outliers if they are not representative of the data distribution.\n",
        "6. Missing Data:\n",
        "\n",
        "Issue: Missing data can lead to biased or incomplete results in logistic regression.\n",
        "Solution:\n",
        "Impute missing data using techniques like mean imputation, median imputation, or predictive modeling (e.g., regression imputation).\n",
        "Consider using models that can handle missing data directly, such as decision trees or Random Forest.\n",
        "7. Interactions and Non-Additivity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Issue: Logistic regression assumes that the relationship between variables is additive. In reality, interactions between variables or non-additive effects may exist.\n",
        "Solution:\n",
        "Include interaction terms in the model to capture interactions between variables.\n",
        "Explore data visualization and domain knowledge to identify potential non-linear relationships.\n",
        "8. Sample Size:\n",
        "\n",
        "Issue: Logistic regression may require a sufficiently large sample size to provide reliable estimates of coefficients and model performance metrics.\n",
        "Solution:\n",
        "If the sample size is small, consider methods like bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals or explore other modeling techniques suited for small datasets.\n",
        "9. Model Evaluation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Issue: Choosing the right evaluation metric is crucial. Accuracy may not be appropriate for imbalanced datasets.\n",
        "Solution:\n",
        "Use evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), or area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) that provide a more balanced view of model performance.\n",
        "10. Interpretability:\n",
        "\n",
        "Issue: Logistic regression provides interpretable coefficients, but complex models may sacrifice interpretability.\n",
        "Solution:\n",
        "Balance interpretability and model performance by using techniques like feature selection, regularization, or simpler model variants.\n",
