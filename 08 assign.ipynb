    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that focuses on simplifying complex reality by modeling classes, objects, and operations with a clear separation between what something does and how it's implemented internally. It allows you to hide the unnecessary details and show only the essential features of an object or system."

    "No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Python. Abstract classes are designed to be incomplete and are meant to be subclassed by concrete classes. They define a common interface and possibly some default behavior, but they lack complete implementations for some methods. As a result, attempting to create an instance of an abstract class would be ambiguous and could lead to unexpected behavior."
