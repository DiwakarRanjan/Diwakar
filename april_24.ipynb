        "In the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a projection is a transformation that reduces the dimensionality of data by mapping it onto a lower-dimensional subspace while preserving as much of the original data's variability as possible. In simpler terms, it involves projecting data points onto a new set of axes (principal components) that capture the most important features or directions of variability in the data. These new axes are typically orthogonal (uncorrelated).\n",

Here's how the choice of the number of principal components can impact PCA's performance:\n",

This can be beneficial when you want to preserve fine-grained details in your data. However, it may not effectively reduce dimensionality, and you might still face challenges related to high-dimensional data, such as increased computational complexity and the curse of dimensionality.\n",
