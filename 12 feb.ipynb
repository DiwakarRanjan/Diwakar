    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, such as trying to divide by zero or accessing a non-existent file, an exception object is raised. This can be caught and handled by the programmer to gracefully manage errors and prevent program crashes.\n",

    "Exceptions: Exceptions are raised during the execution of a program when an error or exceptional situation occurs, such as division by zero, file not found, etc.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Syntax errors occur due to incorrect grammar or structure of the code. They are detected by the Python interpreter before the program starts running.\n",

    "Exceptions: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, allowing you to gracefully manage errors and prevent program crashes.\n",
